    <h1>C# Delegate</h1>
    <pre>
What is Delegate?
   A delegate is a function pointer in C#. It is a reference type data type and it holds the reference of a method. 
    All the delegates are implicitly derived from "System.Delegate" class.

Syntax:

   [accsess modifier] delegate [return type] [delegate name](parameters)

    E.g. 1:     public delegate void Del(string str);
    
Delegate can be used to point to any method that has same return type & parameters declared with delegate

Consider the following method with the same return type and parameters as our "Del" in Example 1

	void Greet(string name)
	{
        Console.WriteLine("Hello"+ name);
    }
    
Now you can create the instance of our delegate like 

 	Del del1 = new Del(Greet);
        (Or)
    
 Del del2 = Greet;

Both does the same thing for us.
