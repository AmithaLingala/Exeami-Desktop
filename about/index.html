    Hello, Welcome to ExeAmi..
    This is my personal website which gives a feel of Desktop, so browse through to know me more.

<div>    This site is still under development, right now these are the things you can do:
         You can try ls, cd, clear, pwd commands on terminal (planning to add plenty more!).
         Browse through the Directories and SubDirectrios like Home/Documents.
         checkout the contact file on Desktop to reach me out for your suggestions and improvements.

         Look into <a href = "https://blog.exeami.com/">my Blog</a> which is the collection of some really intresting topics. 

   I am just learning as I develop this site, feel free to contribute and help me out to make this better.

   These are the things that are in my road map 
        Various daily life sound tracks in Home/Music Directroy, you can use it in games or just enjoy the music.
        Simple, intresting and engaging  web games in Games Directroy.
        Some videos which I find intresting and useful in Home/Videos Directroy.
        Basic Applications such as Calender, calculator, Text Editor with an application menu.
        Many more Terminal commands
        Better User Experiance with custom Theams and backgrounds</div>
